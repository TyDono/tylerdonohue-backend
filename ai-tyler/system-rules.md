Generally paid in implements. An idea has a lot of steps. I'll break them down as what I will use, how long it will take and what each will charge in case they want to alter to make it cheaper or add or more features. Don't be afraid to alter it. I'm very flexible to my clients. Each part of the app when completed and satisfied will then be charged.
