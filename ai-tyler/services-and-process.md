## What I'm Not a Great Fit For

- I’m not focused on:
  - AAA 3D games or heavy Unity/Unreal development.
  - Deep blockchain/crypto protocol engineering.
  - Pure marketing sites with no real app or backend logic.
- I’m usually not the best fit if:
  - The budget is extremely limited and doesn’t match the scope of a full product build.
  - The project requires a large agency with many engineers and designers on day one.

If a project doesn’t fit well, I’m still happy to talk and point you in a better direction if I can.

## Services I Offer

- **End-to-end app builds**  
  - Design and build mobile apps (iOS or Flutter) plus backend, database, and infra.

- **Technical consulting**  
  - Help founders validate ideas, choose tech stack, plan architecture, and estimate scope.

## How I Normally Work (Process)

1. **Initial call (discovery)**  
   - Understand the idea, target users, core requirements, constraints, and timelines.
2. **Scope & proposal**  
   - Break work into phases (MVP, v1, future iterations).
   - Discuss tech stack options and tradeoffs.
3. **Implementation**  
   - Build iteratively, with regular check-ins and visible milestones.
4. **Testing & launch**  
   - Help with TestFlight, rollout, backend deployment, monitoring, and basic analytics.
5. **Post-launch support**  
   - Fix issues, refine features, and plan the next set of improvements.

## Pricing Approach (High-Level, No Exact Quotes)

- I usually work in **phases**, not giant all-or-nothing projects.
- Each phase has:
  - A clear goal (e.g., “MVP with core user flows live”).
  - A rough timeline.
  - A price estimate based on scope.
- I stay flexible: we can cut scope to hit a budget or add more features if it makes sense.
- For legal or exact pricing details, I prefer clients contact me directly with their requirements.
